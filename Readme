This project is my first web application developed using Java and Spring Boot as part of my computer engineering studies. The main goal is to learn the basics of Spring Boot project structure, manage dependencies with Maven, and implement a controller to handle web requests.

The project uses modern tools such as Lombok to reduce boilerplate code, Thymeleaf for rendering HTML pages, and Spring Web to handle HTTP requests.
As a first step, I created a dedicated package that contains a class acting as the first controller of the application. This controller is responsible for testing the initial setup and displaying a basic page in the browser.

This project serves as the foundation on which I will build more advanced features in the future.
